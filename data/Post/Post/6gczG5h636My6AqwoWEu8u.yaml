:title: The Challenge
:body: ! 'However, even with dynamic content in place, every update still required
  a developer to update the repo and deploy the site. Even though this only took a
  minute, it created a bottleneck for our content managers and added up to a significant
  amount of developer time.


  In order to make this idea work at a large scale at our company and on bigger projects,
  we needed to figure out how to automate the management, build, and deployment of
  static sites.


  We made a couple attempts to build a tool ourselves, however we quickly realized
  that building a fully functioning CMS is a lot of work for an agency with many competing
  demands for our dev team. We didn''t want to reinvent the wheel, so instead we started
  to research how we could piece together third party tools into a workable solution.'

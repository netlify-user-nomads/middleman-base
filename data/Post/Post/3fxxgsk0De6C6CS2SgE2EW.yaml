:body: Netlify is an outstanding static hosting platform that provides several useful
  features that bring the rest of our tools together. It supports Node.js tools like
  Roots, so when we deploy it can resolve all our npm dependencies, install roots,
  and run our roots compile build command without a hitch. Once the build is complete,
  we specify a folder to deploy (public in the case of Roots) and Netlify optimizes
  all our assets and pushes it out to a global CDN.

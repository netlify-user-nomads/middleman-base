:title: Building a Static CMS
:body: ! 'We are static evangelists here at Carrot. We''ve written blog posts about
  it, participated in static hackathons, and built a significant arsenal of open source
  tools around static.


  As a result, we''ve replaced a lot of our typical database driven CMS projects with
  static builds. These projects were primarily content based and only required infrequent
  updates to add or remove content. It didn''t make sense to build out so much infrastructure
  (database, hosting, caching, monitoring, code logic, admin interface, etc) for sites
  that are mostly responding to requests with the same HTML over and over.'

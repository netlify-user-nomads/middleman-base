:body: ! 'With the Roots project now built on top of data from Contentful, we then
  set about automating deployment when content changed. First, on Netlify, we created
  a webhook endpoint that would start a new build and deploy the project whenever
  it received a POST request. Then, we set up a webhook in Contentful with the new
  Netlify endpoint as the destination URL. With this in place, every time an editor
  creates, deletes, or edits a new piece of content, Netlify receives a webhook from
  Contentful and kicks off a new deploy. Netlify runs roots compile, loads the new
  Contentful data with roots-contentful, optimizes our assets, and finally pushes
  it out to a global CDN. Within a couple minutes from publishing, our new content
  is live on our static site.


  The Result'

:body: deployment when content changed. First, on Netlify, we created a webhook endpoint
  that would start a new build and deploy the project whenever it received a POST
  request. Then, we set up a webhook in Contentful with the new Netlify endpoint as
  the destination URL. With this in place, every time an editor creates, deletes,
  or edits a new piece of content, Netlify receives a webhook from Contentful and
  kicks off a new deploy. Netlify runs roots compile, loads the new Contentful data
  with roots-contentful, optimizes our assets, and finally pushes it out to a global
  CDN. Within a couple minutes from publishing, our new content is live on our static
  site.
